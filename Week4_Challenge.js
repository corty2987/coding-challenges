//Create a function that takes a number as an argument. 
//Add up all the numbers from 1 to the number you passed to the function. 
//For example, if the input is 4 then your function should return 10 because 
//1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.

//decrement?? i--?
//print every number less than the number entered down to and including 1
//add the numbers printed for the result
